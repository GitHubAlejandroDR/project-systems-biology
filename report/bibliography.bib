   abstract = {La glándula tiroides es un órgano situado en la región anterior del cuello. Consta de dos lóbulos simétricos adosados a los lados de la tráquea y la laringe que están unidos entre sí por el istmo. El tiroides pesa unos 20 g en el adulto sano y surge, desde el punto de vista embriológico, de una proliferación del suelo de la faringe en la tercera semana. La formación desciende hasta alcanzar su situación definitiva, permaneciendo unida a su origen primitivo por el denominado conducto tirogloso. La parte distal de este conducto persiste en el adulto y puede crecer constituyendo el lóbulo piramidal. En ocasiones, alteraciones en el mecanismo de descenso embriológico pueden originar quistes tiroglosos o tejido tiroideo aberrante. Excepcionalmente el tiroides no desciende a su posición normal y puede quedar como glándula única en una situación anómala (tiroides lingual) 1. Figura 1.

   abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on Hashimoto's thyroiditis and its pathogenesis and to introduce the readers to the basic concept of autoimmune thyroid disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease are different expressions of a basically similar autoimmune process, and the clinical appearance reflects the spectrum of the immune response in a particular patient. During this response, cytotoxic autoantibodies, stimulatory autoantibodies, blocking autoantibodies, or cell-mediated autoimmunity may be observed. Persons with classic Hashimoto's thyroiditis have serum antibodies reacting with thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase. These antibodies (particularly antibodies against thyroid peroxidase) are complement-fixing immunoglobulins and may be cytotoxic. In addition, many patients have cell-mediated immunity directed against thyroid antigens. Cell mediated-immunity is also a feature of experimental thyroiditis induced in animals by injection of thyroid antigen with adjuvants. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is predominantly the clinical expression of cell-mediated immunity leading to destruction of thyroid cells, which in its severest form causes thyroid failure. The significance of genetic component and nongenetic risk factors (pregnancy, drugs, age, sex, infection, and irradiation) in the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also reviewed. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the genetic component is important in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, although the pattern of inheritance is non-Mendelian and is likely to be influenced by subtle variations in the functions of multiple genes. Nongenetic risk factors (environmental factors) are also etiologically important, because the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is below 1.},

   abstract = {Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility. Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. Treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.},

   abstract = {It is 70 years since Noel Rose embarked on his pioneering studies that lead to the discovery of autoimmune thyroiditis and the elucidation of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This short review to honour his passing focuses on the developments in our understanding of the causes and pathogenesis of HT over the last five years. Recent genetic studies have reported heritability estimates for HT and associated diseases for the first time, and emphasised the complexity of the genetic factors involved, including monogenic forms of HT. Environmental factors continue to be elucidated, especially as a side effect of drugs which modulate the immune system therapeutically. Regarding pathogenetic mechanisms, multiple cytokine networks have been identified which involve the thyroid cells in a circuit of escalating proinflammatory effects, such as the expression of inflammasome components, and an array of different defects in T regulatory cells may underlie the loss of self-tolerance to thyroid autoantigens. Finally, a number of studies have revealed fresh insights into disease associations with HT which may have both pathological and clinical significance, the most intriguing of which is a possible direct role of the autoimmune process itself in causing some of the persistent symptoms reported by a minority of patients with levothyroxine-treated HT.},

   abstract = {Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, and the incidence of HT continues to increase. Long-term, uncontrollable HT results in thyroid dysfunction and even increases carcinogenesis risks. Since the origin and development of HT involve many complex immune processes, there is no effective therapy for HT on a pathogenesis level. Although bioinformatics analysis has been utilized to seek key genes and pathways of thyroid cancer, only a few bioinformatics studies that focus on HT pathogenesis and mechanisms have been reported. In the present study, the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset (GSE29315) containing 6 HT and 8 thyroid physiological hyperplasia samples was downloaded, and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis were performed. In total, 85 DEGs, containing 76 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated DEGS, were identified. The DEGs were mainly enriched in immune and inflammatory response, and the signaling pathways were involved in cytokine interaction and cytotoxicity. Moreover, ten hub genes were identified, and IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL6/JAK/STAT3, and inflammatory pathways may promote the origin and progression of HT. The present study indicated that exploring DEGs and pathways by bioinformatics analysis has important significance in understanding the molecular mechanisms of HT and providing potential targets for the prevention and treatment of HT.},

In this review, we aim to present and discuss some challenges associated with the nutritional management of TH, focusing on environmental and dietary deficits, inflammatory and toxic nutrients, cyanotoxins, etc. We discuss the relationships among different diets, chronic inflammation, and microbiota, and their impact on the development and exacerbation of TH in detail. We share some novel insights into the role of vitamin D and melatonin for preserving thyroid function during chronic inflammation in autoimmune predisposed subjects. A comprehensive overview is provided on anti-inflammatory nutrients and ecological diets, including foods for cleansing and detoxification, which represent strategies to prevent relapses and achieve overall improvement of life quality. In conclusion, data from biomedical and clinical studies provide evidence that an appropriate dietary and lighting regimen could significantly improve the function of the thyroid gland and reduce the reactivity of autoantibodies in TH. Compliance with nutritional guidelines may help TH patients to reduce the need for medicines.},

A total of 128 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (55 with Graves' disease (GD) and 73 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT)) were typed for HLA DQA1 (0301 and 0501) and DQB1 (0201, 0302, and 0303) and for 49A/G CTLA-4 using PCR-based sequence-specific priming methods. A total of 186 matched controls were typed for the same alleles and compared to the diseased population. Results showed no significant differences in HLA DQB1*0201 or DQB1 *0301 allelic frequencies or CTLA-4 polymorphisms between patients and controls. For GD, there was a weak association with HLA DQB1 *0302 [34.6% (19 of 55) vs. 21.5% (40 of 186), P00.048, odds ratio (OR)01.926, confidence interval (CI)00.999-3.715] and HLA DQB1 *0302-DQA1*0501 haplotype [56.36% (31 of 55) vs. 40.8% (76 of 186), P00.042, OR01.870, CI01.018-3.433]. For HT, the frequencies of DQB1*0302-DQA1*0501 haplotype [28.8% (21 of 73) vs. 14.5% (27 of 186), P00.008, OR02.378, CI01.241-4.558] and DQB1*0302-DQA1*0301 haplotype [60.2% (44 of 73) vs. 38.7% (72 of 186), P00.002, OR02.402, CI01.381-4.180] were significantly higher in patients. On the other hand, weak association was found between HT and DQA1*0301 allele [32.9% (24 of 73) vs. 20.9% (39 of 186), P00.044, OR01.846, CI01.011-3.373]. Findings show that DQB1 *0302-DQA1*0501 and DQB1 *0302-DQA1*0301 haplotypes may play a role in the pathogenesis of HT in the Lebanese population.

Las causas más comunes son la deficiencia de yodo y la tiroiditis autoinmune linfocítica crónica. El cuadro clínico del hipotiroidismo es bastante amplio afectando diferentes órganos y sistemas. El manejo de esta patología se hace con reemplazo hormonal, para ello levotiroxina es la indicación.  El hipertiroidismo por su parte, hace referencia al incremento sostenido de las hormonas tiroideas debido al aumento de biosíntesis y secreción de la tiroides. Entre las principales causas se encuentra la enfermedad de Graves Basedow (EG). Su presentación clínica es amplia y varía de asintomática a una tormenta tiroidea que compromete la vida del paciente. El tratamiento está basado en medicamentos antitiroideos pero también se han diseñado otras alternativas como yodo radioactivo y tiroidectomía. También las enfermedades que afectan directamente la tiroides, como el cáncer, son de gran importancia; la evidencia obtenida en numerosos estudios sugiere que los polimorfismos genéticos influencian el riesgo de carcinogénesis y que la susceptibilidad genética es un factor importante para el desarrollo del cáncer. Los avances genéticos en esta patología han permitido una compresión mas a fondo de las diferencias en el comportamiento de los trastornos tiroideos entre una persona y otra, así mismo han generado un nuevo punto de partida para el tratamiento farmacológico.},

   abstract = {Protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is a multifunctional PKC family member and has been implicated in many types of cancers, including liver cancer. Recently, we have reported that PKCδ is secreted from liver cancer cells, and involved in cell proliferation and tumor growth. However, it remains unclear whether the extracellular PKCδ directly regulates cell surface growth factor receptors. Here, we identify epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a novel interacting protein of the cell surface PKCδ in liver cancer cells. Imaging studies showed that secreted PKCδ interacted with EGFR-expressing cells in both autocrine and paracrine manners. Biochemical analysis revealed that PKCδ bound to the extracellular domain of EGFR. We further found that a part of the amino acid sequence on the C-terminal region of PKCδ was similar to the putative EGFR binding site of EGF. In this regard, the point mutant of PKCδ in the binding site lacked the ability to bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR. Upon an extracellular PKCδ-EGFR association, ERK1/2 activation, downstream of EGFR signaling, was apparently induced in liver cancer cells. This study indicates that extracellular PKCδ behaves as a growth factor and provides a molecular basis for extracellular PKCδ-targeting therapy for liver cancer.},

Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

   abstract = {Currently, numerous papers are published reporting analysis of biological data at different omics levels by making statistical inferences. Of note, many studies, as those published in this Journal, report association of gene(s) at the genomic and transcriptomic levels by undertaking appropriate statistical tests. For instance, genotype, allele or haplotype frequencies at the genomic level or normalized expression levels at the transcriptomic level are compared between the case and control groups using the Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test or independent (i.e. two-sampled) t-test respectively, with this culminating into a single numeric, namely the P value (or the degree of the false positive rate), which is used to make or break the outcome of the association test. This approach has flaws but nevertheless remains a standard and convenient approach in association studies. However, what becomes a critical issue is that the same cut-off is used when ‘multiple’ tests are undertaken on the same case-control (or any pairwise) comparison. Here, in brevity, we present what the P value represents, and why and when it should be adjusted. We also show, with worked examples, how to adjust P values for multiple testing in the R environment for statistical computing (http://www.R-project.org).},

   abstract = {Network theory has become pervasive in all sectors of biology, from biochemical signalling patterns to the structure of human societies, but it has proved difficult to identify relevant functional communities because many nodes belong to several overlapping groups at once and are involved in hierarchical structures. Ahn et al., rather than considering nodes combining to form a tree or dendrogram as the natural community structure, suggest that communities of linkage can explain both overlap and hierarchical organization in networks. They use mobile-phone company records, representing the call patterns and locations of millions of users, to show that branches of the hierarchy are geographically correlated at multiple levels (neighbourhood, city and region) while keeping significant overlap. Linkage dendograms of this type are also demonstrated in published data on protein–protein interactions and metabolic networks. Network theory has become pervasive in all sectors of biology, from biochemical signalling to human societies, but identification of relevant functional communities has been impaired by many nodes belonging to several overlapping groups at once, and by hierarchical structures. These authors offer a radically different viewpoint, focusing on links rather than nodes, which allows them to demonstrate that overlapping communities and network hierarchies are two faces of the same issue. Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society1,2,3. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities4,5: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes6,7 or social spheres8,9,10. Communities in networks often overlap9,10 such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure11,12,13. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein–protein interaction6,7,14 and metabolic networks11,15,16, and show that a large social network10,17,18 contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.},

The R package 'linkcomm' implements this algorithm and extends it in several aspects: (i) the clustering algorithm handles networks that are weighted, directed, or both weighted and directed; (ii) several visualization methods are implemented that facilitate the representation of the link communities and their relationships; (iii) a suite of functions are included for the downstream analysis of the link communities including novel community-based measures of node centrality; (iv) the main algorithm is written in C++ and designed to handle networks of any size; and (v) several clustering methods are available for networks that can be handled in memory, and the number of communities can be adjusted by the user.},

   abstract = {The observation that disease associated proteins often interact with each other has fueled the development of network-based approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of human disease. Such approaches build on the assumption that protein interaction networks can be viewed as maps in which diseases can be identified with localized perturbation within a certain neighborhood. The identification of these neighborhoods, or disease modules, is therefore a prerequisite of a detailed investigation of a particular pathophenotype. While numerous heuristic methods exist that successfully pinpoint disease associated modules, the basic underlying connectivity patterns remain largely unexplored. In this work we aim to fill this gap by analyzing the network properties of a comprehensive corpus of 70 complex diseases. We find that disease associated proteins do not reside within locally dense communities and instead identify connectivity significance as the most predictive quantity. This quantity inspires the design of a novel Disease Module Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm to identify the full disease module around a set of known disease proteins. We study the performance of the algorithm using well-controlled synthetic data and systematically validate the identified neighborhoods for a large corpus of diseases.},

 @article{Zhang2010,
   abstract = {Motivation: A typical approach for the interpretation of high-throughput experiments, such as gene expression microarrays, is to produce groups of genes based on certain criteria (e.g. genes that are differentially expressed). To gain more mechanistic insights into the underlying biology, overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is often conducted to investigate whether gene sets associated with particular biological functions, for example, as represented by Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, are statistically overrepresented in the identified gene groups. However, the standard ORA, which is based on the hypergeometric test, analyzes each GO term in isolation and does not take into account the dependence structure of the GO-term hierarchy. Results: We have developed a Bayesian approach (GO-Bayes) to measure overrepresentation of GO terms that incorporates the GO dependence structure by taking into account evidence not only from individual GO terms, but also from their related terms (i.e. parents, children, siblings, etc.). The Bayesian framework borrows information across related GO terms to strengthen the detection of overrepresentation signals. As a result, this method tends to identify sets of closely related GO terms rather than individual isolated GO terms. The advantage of the GO-Bayes approach is demonstrated with a simulation study and an application example. Contact: song.zhang@utsouthwestern.edu; richard.scheuermann@utsouthwestern.edu.

@article{LvanParijs1998,
   abstract = {Peripheral tolerance to self proteins is induced because these antigens are presented to T lymphocytes under conditions that do not allow effective immune responses to develop, or because the responses of the specific T cells are tightly regulated. The two principal mechanisms of peripheral tolerance are activation-induced cell death (AICD) and anergy. In CD4+ T lymphocytes, AICD is induced by repeated stimulation, with high levels of interleukin (IL)-2 production. Under these conditions, the T cells co-express Fas (CD95) and Fas ligand (FasL), and engagement of Fas triggers apoptotic death of the T cells. Mice with defects in Fas, FasL, IL-2R alpha or beta chain exhibit defects in AICD and develop autoimmune disease. The induction of T cell anergy is dependent on the recognition of B7 co-stimulators by the inhibitory T cell counter-receptor, CTLA-4. Failure of anergy is the likely basis for the fatal autoimmune disease of CTLA-4 knockout mice. The single-gene defects that result in autoimmunity are all defects in lymphocyte regulation, indicating that tolerance is often maintained by the control of lymphocyte responses to self antigen. The existence of distinct pathways of T cell tolerance suggest that different types of antigens induce tolerance by distinct mechanisms.},

The latest studies proved phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) might contribute to the surviving, proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA. The purpose of this study was to explore the function and underlying mechanisms of PTEN in RA pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). Increased level of PTEN was observed in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) FLSs in comparison to normal rats. Increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β), chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), VCAM-1 and VEGF-α expression were observed in FLSs with PTEN inhibitor bpv or PTEN-RNAi. Moreover, co-incubation FLSs with overexpression vector with PTEN-GV141 reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, VCAM-1 and VEGF-α in AIA. Interestingly, we also found DNA methylation could regulate PTEN expression and activation of AKT signaling was with a change of PTEN. Altogether, our findings in the present study suggested that PTEN might play a pivotal role during pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines of FLSs through activation of AKT signaling pathway. In addition, PTEN expression may be regulated by DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of AIA.},

   abstract = {Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by robust microgliosis and phenotypic changes that accompany disease pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence from genetic studies suggests the importance of phospholipase C γ 2 (PLCG2) in late-onset AD (LOAD) pathophysiology. However, the role of PLCG2 in AD is still poorly understood. Methods: Using bulk RNA-Seq (N=1249) data from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium (AMP-AD), we investigated whether PLCG2 expression increased in the brains of LOAD patients. We also evaluated the relationship between PLCG2 expression levels, amyloid plaque density, and expression levels of microglia specific markers (AIF1 and TMEM119). Finally, we investigated the longitudinal changes of PLCG2 expression in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. To further understand the role of PLCG2 in different signaling pathways, differential gene expression and co-expression network analyses were performed using bulk RNA-Seq and microglial single-cell RNA-Seq data. To substantiate the human analyses, we performed differential gene expression analysis on wild-type (WT) and inactivated Plcg2 mice and used immunostaining to determine if the differentially expressed genes/pathways were altered by microglial cell coverage or morphology. Results: We observed significant upregulation of PLCG2 expression in three brain regions of LOAD patients and significant positive correlation of PLCG2 expression with amyloid plaque density. These findings in the human brain were validated in the 5xFAD amyloid mouse model, which showed disease progression-dependent increases in Plcg2 expression associated with amyloid pathology. Of note, increased Plcg2 expression levels in 5xFAD mice were abolished by reducing microglia. Furthermore, using bulk RNA-Seq data, we performed differential expression analysis by comparing cognitively normal older adults (CN) with 75th percentile (high) and 25th percentile (low) PLCG2 gene expression levels to identify pathways related to inflammation and the inflammatory response. The findings in the human brain were validated by differential expression analyses between WT and plcg2 inactivated mice. PLCG2 co-expression network analysis of microglial single-cell RNA-Seq data identified pathways related to the inflammatory response including regulation of I-kappaB/NF-kappa B signaling and response to lipopolysaccharide. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence that PLCG2 plays an important role in AD pathophysiology and may be a potential target for microglia-targeted AD therapies.},

The altered function of either may underlie the pathophysiology of autoimmune and/or chronic inflammatory diseases and manipulation of these pathways is an important emerging area of therapeutics. We report here that the immunosuppressant drug CTLA4-Ig inhibits the effector phase of allergic airway inflammation through a CD28-independent, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent mechanism. Using mice deficient in both B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and CD28, we demonstrate that simultaneous deficiency of an inhibitory receptor can rescue the in vivo but not the in vitro CD28-deficient phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inflammation in CD28/BTLA-double-deficient mice is suppressed by CTLA4-Ig. This suppression is reversed by treatment with the NOS inhibitor, N6-methyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMMA). In addition, CTLA4-Ig is ineffective at inhibiting inflammation in NOS2-deficient mice when given at the effector phase. Thus, CD28 and BTLA coordinately regulate the in vivo response to inhaled allergen, and CTLA4-Ig binding to B7-proteins inhibits the effector phase of inflammation by a CD28-independent, NOS-dependent mechanism. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

   abstract = {Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that destroys thyroid cells by cell and antibody-mediated immune processes. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries. In contrast, worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is an inadequate dietary intake of iodine. This disease is also known as chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The pathology of the disease involves the formation of antithyroid antibodies that attack thyroid tissue, causing progressive fibrosis. The diagnosis is often challenging and does not occur until later on in the disease process. The most common laboratory findings demonstrate an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low thyroxine (T4) levels coupled with increased anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. However, earlier on the in the course of the disease, patients may exhibit signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of hyperthyroidism or normal values. This is because the destruction of the thyroid gland cells may be intermittent.Women are more often affected. The female-to-male ratio is at least 10:1. Although some sources cite diagnosis happening more so in the fifth decade of life, most women are diagnosed between the ages of 30 to 50 years old. Conventional treatment occurs with levothyroxine at the recommended dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg/day. The T4 converts to T3, which is the active form of thyroid hormone in the human body. Excessive supplementation can lead to deleterious and morbid effects, including but not limited to arrhythmias (the most common being atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis.
