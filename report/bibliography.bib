   abstract = {La glándula tiroides es un órgano situado en la región anterior del cuello. Consta de dos lóbulos simétricos adosados a los lados de la tráquea y la laringe que están unidos entre sí por el istmo. El tiroides pesa unos 20 g en el adulto sano y surge, desde el punto de vista embriológico, de una proliferación del suelo de la faringe en la tercera semana. La formación desciende hasta alcanzar su situación definitiva, permaneciendo unida a su origen primitivo por el denominado conducto tirogloso. La parte distal de este conducto persiste en el adulto y puede crecer constituyendo el lóbulo piramidal. En ocasiones, alteraciones en el mecanismo de descenso embriológico pueden originar quistes tiroglosos o tejido tiroideo aberrante. Excepcionalmente el tiroides no desciende a su posición normal y puede quedar como glándula única en una situación anómala (tiroides lingual) 1. Figura 1.

   abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on Hashimoto's thyroiditis and its pathogenesis and to introduce the readers to the basic concept of autoimmune thyroid disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease are different expressions of a basically similar autoimmune process, and the clinical appearance reflects the spectrum of the immune response in a particular patient. During this response, cytotoxic autoantibodies, stimulatory autoantibodies, blocking autoantibodies, or cell-mediated autoimmunity may be observed. Persons with classic Hashimoto's thyroiditis have serum antibodies reacting with thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase. These antibodies (particularly antibodies against thyroid peroxidase) are complement-fixing immunoglobulins and may be cytotoxic. In addition, many patients have cell-mediated immunity directed against thyroid antigens. Cell mediated-immunity is also a feature of experimental thyroiditis induced in animals by injection of thyroid antigen with adjuvants. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is predominantly the clinical expression of cell-mediated immunity leading to destruction of thyroid cells, which in its severest form causes thyroid failure. The significance of genetic component and nongenetic risk factors (pregnancy, drugs, age, sex, infection, and irradiation) in the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also reviewed. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the genetic component is important in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, although the pattern of inheritance is non-Mendelian and is likely to be influenced by subtle variations in the functions of multiple genes. Nongenetic risk factors (environmental factors) are also etiologically important, because the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is below 1.},

   abstract = {Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility. Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. Treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.},

   abstract = {It is 70 years since Noel Rose embarked on his pioneering studies that lead to the discovery of autoimmune thyroiditis and the elucidation of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This short review to honour his passing focuses on the developments in our understanding of the causes and pathogenesis of HT over the last five years. Recent genetic studies have reported heritability estimates for HT and associated diseases for the first time, and emphasised the complexity of the genetic factors involved, including monogenic forms of HT. Environmental factors continue to be elucidated, especially as a side effect of drugs which modulate the immune system therapeutically. Regarding pathogenetic mechanisms, multiple cytokine networks have been identified which involve the thyroid cells in a circuit of escalating proinflammatory effects, such as the expression of inflammasome components, and an array of different defects in T regulatory cells may underlie the loss of self-tolerance to thyroid autoantigens. Finally, a number of studies have revealed fresh insights into disease associations with HT which may have both pathological and clinical significance, the most intriguing of which is a possible direct role of the autoimmune process itself in causing some of the persistent symptoms reported by a minority of patients with levothyroxine-treated HT.},

   abstract = {Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, and the incidence of HT continues to increase. Long-term, uncontrollable HT results in thyroid dysfunction and even increases carcinogenesis risks. Since the origin and development of HT involve many complex immune processes, there is no effective therapy for HT on a pathogenesis level. Although bioinformatics analysis has been utilized to seek key genes and pathways of thyroid cancer, only a few bioinformatics studies that focus on HT pathogenesis and mechanisms have been reported. In the present study, the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset (GSE29315) containing 6 HT and 8 thyroid physiological hyperplasia samples was downloaded, and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis were performed. In total, 85 DEGs, containing 76 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated DEGS, were identified. The DEGs were mainly enriched in immune and inflammatory response, and the signaling pathways were involved in cytokine interaction and cytotoxicity. Moreover, ten hub genes were identified, and IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL6/JAK/STAT3, and inflammatory pathways may promote the origin and progression of HT. The present study indicated that exploring DEGs and pathways by bioinformatics analysis has important significance in understanding the molecular mechanisms of HT and providing potential targets for the prevention and treatment of HT.},

In this review, we aim to present and discuss some challenges associated with the nutritional management of TH, focusing on environmental and dietary deficits, inflammatory and toxic nutrients, cyanotoxins, etc. We discuss the relationships among different diets, chronic inflammation, and microbiota, and their impact on the development and exacerbation of TH in detail. We share some novel insights into the role of vitamin D and melatonin for preserving thyroid function during chronic inflammation in autoimmune predisposed subjects. A comprehensive overview is provided on anti-inflammatory nutrients and ecological diets, including foods for cleansing and detoxification, which represent strategies to prevent relapses and achieve overall improvement of life quality. In conclusion, data from biomedical and clinical studies provide evidence that an appropriate dietary and lighting regimen could significantly improve the function of the thyroid gland and reduce the reactivity of autoantibodies in TH.

A total of 128 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (55 with Graves' disease (GD) and 73 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT)) were typed for HLA DQA1 (0301 and 0501) and DQB1 (0201, 0302, and 0303) and for 49A/G CTLA-4 using PCR-based sequence-specific priming methods. A total of 186 matched controls were typed for the same alleles and compared to the diseased population. Results showed no significant differences in HLA DQB1*0201 or DQB1 *0301 allelic frequencies or CTLA-4 polymorphisms between patients and controls. For GD, there was a weak association with HLA DQB1 *0302 [34.6% (19 of 55) vs. 21.5% (40 of 186), P00.048, odds ratio (OR)01.926, confidence interval (CI)00.999-3.715] and HLA DQB1 *0302-DQA1*0501 haplotype [56.36% (31 of 55) vs. 40.8% (76 of 186), P00.042, OR01.870, CI01.018-3.433].

Las causas más comunes son la deficiencia de yodo y la tiroiditis autoinmune linfocítica crónica. El cuadro clínico del hipotiroidismo es bastante amplio afectando diferentes órganos y sistemas. El manejo de esta patología se hace con reemplazo hormonal, para ello levotiroxina es la indicación.  El hipertiroidismo por su parte, hace referencia al incremento sostenido de las hormonas tiroideas debido al aumento de biosíntesis y secreción de la tiroides. Entre las principales causas se encuentra la enfermedad de Graves Basedow (EG). Su presentación clínica es amplia y varía de asintomática a una tormenta tiroidea que compromete la vida del paciente. El tratamiento está basado en medicamentos antitiroideos pero también se han diseñado otras alternativas como yodo radioactivo y tiroidectomía. También las enfermedades que afectan directamente la tiroides, como el cáncer, son de gran importancia; la evidencia obtenida en numerosos estudios sugiere que los polimorfismos genéticos influencian el riesgo de carcinogénesis y que la susceptibilidad genética es un factor importante para el desarrollo del cáncer. Los avances genéticos en esta patología han permitido una compresión mas a fondo de las diferencias en el comportamiento de los trastornos tiroideos entre una persona y otra, así mismo han generado un nuevo punto de partida para el tratamiento farmacológico.},

   abstract = {Protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is a multifunctional PKC family member and has been implicated in many types of cancers, including liver cancer. Recently, we have reported that PKCδ is secreted from liver cancer cells, and involved in cell proliferation and tumor growth. However, it remains unclear whether the extracellular PKCδ directly regulates cell surface growth factor receptors. Here, we identify epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a novel interacting protein of the cell surface PKCδ in liver cancer cells. Imaging studies showed that secreted PKCδ interacted with EGFR-expressing cells in both autocrine and paracrine manners. Biochemical analysis revealed that PKCδ bound to the extracellular domain of EGFR. We further found that a part of the amino acid sequence on the C-terminal region of PKCδ was similar to the putative EGFR binding site of EGF. In this regard, the point mutant of PKCδ in the binding site lacked the ability to bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR. Upon an extracellular PKCδ-EGFR association, ERK1/2 activation, downstream of EGFR signaling, was apparently induced in liver cancer cells. This study indicates that extracellular PKCδ behaves as a growth factor and provides a molecular basis for extracellular PKCδ-targeting therapy for liver cancer.},

Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.
